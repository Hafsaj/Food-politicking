<h1>A Hillary victory may open a Pandora's box of bad in 2018 and 2020</h1>
<p>22 September 2016</p>

<p>Progressive wisdom-makers are overrating the importance to the country and the world of Hillary Clinton beating Donald Trump. Hillary’s victory will have its own negative side effects in 2018 and 2020 and a Trump victory has some underrated silver linings.</p>

<h3 id="thinking-a-few-moves-ahead-makes-me-feel-nervous-about-a-hillary-victory">Thinking a few moves ahead makes me feel nervous about a Hillary victory</h3>

<p>Hillary is fabulous. This post is no paean to Berine-or-busters or third-party-apologists. The problem is that Hillary will have two years to appoint Supreme Court Justices… and not do much else. With the House of Representatives <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/06/27/ratfcked-the-influence-of-redistricting">ratfucked</a> into a Republican stranglehold, we can forget ambitious policy proposals of almost any sort. Instead, Hillary will spend her first term trying to modernize America’s infrastructure (Obama name-checks this priority at 2:40 in <a href="https://www.facebook.com/potus/videos/533791280144050/">this video</a>) and perhaps do things around the edges to make government policy more generous to working women, families, children (i.e. <a href="http://www.vox.com/2016/8/16/12500798/clinton-transition-team-salazar">check out her transition team</a>). Whatever she tries to do, she’ll need to work with a Republican House. Let’s be honest: she’ll spend most of her political capital getting the GOP to refrain from causing debt defaults and government shutdowns over funding for planned parenthood and other matters critical to the long-term well-being of the country.</p>

<p>Come 2018, the Senate will flip back Republican — Politico is even talking about a <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2016/09/senate-2018-democrats-228055">Republican super-majority</a>. Democrats will be defending many more Senate seats than Republicans, midterms are unfavorable to Democrats because the demographics of midterm voters are more Republican-leaning (older and whiter) than in Presidential election years, and there may be a strong backlash to Hillary by 2018 (as there was to Obama in 2010 and to some extent 2014). We can forget about Hillary being able to do anything whatsoever after 2018. I’ll be amazed if she can even appoint Supreme Court Justices (should another vacancy open up) after the Republicans take the Senate back.</p>

<p>By 2020, Hillary will lose her bid for re-election to Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio, or Paul Ryan. It’s hard to predict events four years in advance — maybe the economy continues improving and by 2020 we’re partying like it’s 1999… but I think the smart money is on Hillary being a one-term President, unfortunately.</p>

<p>By contrast, should Trump win in 2016, 2018 will be a better year for Democrats — although they’ll still face the usual tough midterm demographics, the midterm backlash against President Trump will put wind in their sales. Trump will lose his bid for reelection in 2020 to Cory Booker, Elizabeth Warren, or Tim Kaine.</p>

<h3 id="trumps-value-below-replacement-level-republican-isnt-terribly-significant">Trump’s value below replacement-level Republican isn’t terribly significant</h3>

<p>And is Trump really so terrible? I’m not convinced. He’s terrible in absolute terms, but graded against other potential Republican candidates for President, his outrageousness isn’t super-significant. A Republican is going to win one of these years, and I’m not sure that Trump will be worse than the alternatives.</p>

<p>He has a shamelessly vindictive temperament, he lies, he possesses downright extreme inattention to policy details, his demonization of Muslims, Latinos, and immigrants is unforgivable, he uses racism as a political wedge in general, and he is a climate change denier.</p>

<p>But:</p>

<p>Ted Cruz was just as extreme on immigration policy, more extreme in his zeal to restrict abortion rights, and a more bombastic and trigger-happy potential Commander in Chief. Indeed, the other two key Republican alternatives to Trump — Marco Rubio and Jeb Bush — were dyed-in-the-wool unapologetic Neoconservatives. Trump’s repudiation of the Iraq war — and his bizarre willingness to make <a href="http://www.vox.com/2016/9/7/12842998/trump-iraq-libya-lie-command-in-chief-forum">bald-faced lies that he opposed the Iraq war</a> from the start — are actually a welcome change amidst a sea of Republicans who haven’t been humbled in any way by our troubles in Iraq.</p>

<p>2020’s most likely Republican candidate is Paul Ryan – a stunningly handsome but <a href="https://twitter.com/mattyglesias/status/761663715947208704">disingenuous</a> and <a href="http://voices.washingtonpost.com/ezra-klein/2010/02/rep_paul_ryans_daring_budget_p.html">dangerous</a> cyborg created by the Koch brothers and sent back in time to shred America’s social safety net once and for all.</p>

<p>What’s more, almost all of these alternatives will be more adept at working with Republicans in Congress to collaboratively make scary policy choices. For those of us who want to give legal status to undocumented immigrants, protect Obamacare and America’s wider social safety net, and maintain Obama’s fragile climate change legacy, the smart move might very well be Trump in 2016 + better chance of Dem Senate through 2020 + better chance of Cory Booker in 2020 + lower chance of Paul Ryan in 2020.</p>

<h3 id="just-kidding">Just kidding</h3>

<p>Meh, I haven’t even persuaded myself. Politics isn’t chess. It’s too unpredictable for anyone to think this many moves in advance. Better to support the best candidate during any given election.</p>

<p>Hillary will have two years to nominate a Supreme Court Justice or two and four years to use executive action to protect Obama’s healthcare reform, coordinate further international action against climate change, try again to protect DREAMers from deportation, and craft intelligent and careful foreign policy.</p>

<p>The foreign policy is especially important. Iraq War repudiation aside, Donald J. Trump really shouldn’t have his hands on the nuclear codes, and even in the face of unflinching Congressional opposition, President Clinton will have a chance to practice sound foreign policy.</p>
