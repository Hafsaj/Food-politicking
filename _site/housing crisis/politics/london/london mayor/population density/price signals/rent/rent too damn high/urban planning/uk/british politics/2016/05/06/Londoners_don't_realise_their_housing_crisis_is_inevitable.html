<h1>Londoners don't realise their housing crisis is inevitable unless they start building denser and taller</h1>
<p>06 May 2016</p>
<img src="/images/stack_of_newspapers_UK_smaller.jpg" class="post_image"/> <!---image-->


<p>In London, everyone agrees the rent is too damn high. But instead of demanding new housing, Londoners are obsessed with the idea that they can solve their housing crisis by regulating it away. The candidates for mayor make noises about increasing housing stock, but the real emotion is in regulatory fixes.</p>

<p>Londoners proudly protest new builds that they know will charge high rent and command high prices. <strong>But doesn’t London need new housing, the naive American ex-pat asks?</strong> Londoners knowingly explain that there are many unoccupied homes bought by foreigners as investment vehicles whose emptiness squeezes rents and prices ever upward. In this way, they explain how they can have their cake and eat it too. The empty houses can be filled by force, the city can remain the same, housing stock can remain where it is, and everyone can live happily ever after.</p>

<p>This turns out to be untrue. The <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/housing-network/2013/nov/14/london-property-foreign-investors">vast majority</a> of foreign buyers are either living in their purchases or letting them out. Yet the emotional energy is behind these kinds of ideas that fix the crisis without building more housing. The leading candidate for mayor, Sadiq Khan, has truly ridiculous proposals that pander to this emotional energy:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>*He wants to use mayoral powers and land to stop "buy-to-leave" and to give "first dibs" to first-time buyers and local tenants. Sounds good, but by adding more friction into the building-and-selling process, the policy could slow down home-building in the first place.
*He will create "a new form of affordable housing, with rent based on a third of average local income, not market rates." But rent control and price controls depress supply, and depressed supply is already the major problem here.
*He will implement "landlord licensing schemes – naming and shaming bad landlords and promoting good ones so you know what you’re getting yourself into." &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/post/the-occupational-licensing-racket-wonkbook/2012/06/13/gJQAd59dZV_blog.html"&gt;Licensing schemes are the worst&lt;/a&gt;, and this one seems especially bad and unnecessary, adding a new friction into an already frictiontastic market. Moreover, if people want someone to name and shame landlords, &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/money/2012/mar/09/tenants-landlords-grievances-online"&gt;there are businesses that already exist to do so&lt;/a&gt;.
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>His main opposition, Zac Goldsmith, at least recognises the problem. He <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/zac-goldsmith-london-sadiq-khan_uk_571ea2e6e4b0d6f7bed4c8ce">notes</a> that over the last decade, the average number of new homes built in London has been around 19,400 – well below the average 66,000 new houses constructed each year <strong>in the 1930s (which was 80 YEARS AGO)</strong>.</p>

<p>But even though Goldsmith gets the main problem, he also loves a good pander to Londoners’ desire for their leaders to regulate the evil developers. As an EU-skeptic, he mixes things up with some good old fashioned xenophobia. His key promise is to make sure homes are offered “first to Londoners.” This is either quasi-racist and unenforceable, unduly friction-creating, or all of the above.</p>

<p>Even well-thought-out analyses of London’s housing crunch think about keyhole fixes. Here’s a nice <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/davehillblog/2016/mar/29/which-london-mayor-candidate-will-fix-the-capitals-housing-crisis">Guardian article whose thesis</a> is basically that London’s mayors have to make some hard choices about whether to develop polluted land into housing.</p>

<p>The real problem is less complicated. London is a super-flat city. It thinks of itself as a dense European city (don’t get a Londoner started about the crowded tube) but it’s actually much more like Los Angeles <a href="http://www.demographia.com/db-lonlanypar.htm">in terms of population density</a>. New York City and Paris are both almost twice as dense. As long as the fancy new builds Londoners love to hate continue being constrained into flats that are three to four stories tall, it’s not really important whether they’re being set aside for affordable housing or are being sold to the highest bidder. Unless developers can start building denser and taller, London’s housing crunch will get ever crunchier.</p>
